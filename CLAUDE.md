# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Fli is a Python library that provides programmatic access to Google Flights data through direct API interaction (reverse engineering). The project consists of:

- **CLI interface** (`fli/cli/`) - Typer-based command line tool with `flights` and `dates` commands
- **MCP server** (`fli/mcp/`) - Model Context Protocol server for AI assistant integration
- **Core utilities** (`fli/core/`) - Shared parsing and building utilities
- **Search engine** (`fli/search/`) - Flight and date search implementations using Google Flights API
- **Data models** (`fli/models/`) - Pydantic models for airports, airlines, and flight data structures

## Development Commands

### Core Development Tasks
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --all-extras

# Run tests (use these specific commands)
make test                    # Standard test suite
make test-fuzz              # Run fuzzing tests (pytest -vv --fuzz)
make test-all               # Run all tests (pytest -vv --all)
uv run pytest -vv           # Alternative direct command

# Code quality
make lint                   # Check code with ruff
make lint-fix              # Auto-fix linting issues
make format                 # Format code with ruff
uv run ruff check .         # Direct ruff check
uv run ruff format .        # Direct ruff format

# MCP server
fli-mcp                     # Run MCP server on STDIO
fli-mcp-http               # Run MCP server over HTTP

# Documentation
make docs                   # Build MkDocs documentation
uv run mkdocs serve         # Serve docs locally
uv run mkdocs build         # Build static docs
```

### Test Configuration
- Tests use pytest with custom markers: `fuzz` (requires `--fuzz` flag) and `parallel` (for pytest-xdist)
- Test structure mirrors source code: `tests/cli/`, `tests/models/`, `tests/search/`, `tests/mcp/`
- Fuzzing tests are available but gated behind `--fuzz` flag

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Core Layer** (`fli/core/`)
   - `parsers.py`: Shared parsing utilities (airports, airlines, stops, cabin class, time ranges)
   - `builders.py`: Filter building utilities (flight segments, time restrictions)
   - Used by both CLI and MCP for consistent parameter handling

2. **Client Layer** (`fli/search/client.py`)
   - Rate-limited HTTP client (10 req/sec) using curl-cffi for browser impersonation
   - Automatic retries with exponential backoff
   - Session management for Google Flights API communication

3. **Search Engine** (`fli/search/`)
   - `SearchFlights`: Core flight search using Google Flights API
   - `SearchDates`: Find cheapest dates within date ranges
   - Direct API integration (no web scraping)

4. **Data Models** (`fli/models/`)
   - **Base models**: `Airport`, `Airline` enums with IATA codes
   - **Google Flights models**: `FlightSearchFilters`, `FlightResult`, `FlightLeg`, etc.
   - **Filter models**: `TimeRestrictions`, `MaxStops`, `SeatType`, `SortBy`
   - All models use Pydantic for validation

5. **MCP Server** (`fli/mcp/`)
   - FastMCP-based server with two tools: `search_flights` and `search_dates`
   - Industry-standard parameter naming: `origin`, `destination`, `cabin_class`, `max_stops`
   - Prompt templates for guided searches
   - Configuration via environment variables

6. **CLI Interface** (`fli/cli/`)
   - Typer-based with two main commands: `flights` and `dates`
   - Smart argument parsing (treats non-command args as flights)
   - Rich console output for flight results

### Key Design Patterns

- **Direct API Access**: Uses reverse-engineered Google Flights API endpoints (not web scraping)
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in 10 req/sec limit with automatic retry logic
- **Enum-Based Configuration**: Airports, airlines, seat types, etc. are strongly typed enums
- **Filter Pattern**: Search functionality uses comprehensive filter objects
- **Shared Utilities**: Core parsing/building logic shared between CLI and MCP
- **Validation**: Pydantic models ensure data integrity throughout

## MCP Tool Reference

### `search_flights`
Search for flights on a specific date.

**Key Parameters:**
- `origin` / `destination` - Airport IATA codes (comma-separated for multi-airport)
- `departure_date` / `return_date` - Dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `cabin_class` - ECONOMY, PREMIUM_ECONOMY, BUSINESS, FIRST
- `max_stops` - ANY, NON_STOP, ONE_STOP, TWO_PLUS_STOPS
- `departure_window` - Time range in 'HH-HH' format
- `airlines` / `exclude_airlines` - Include / exclude airline IATA codes
- `alliance` / `exclude_alliance` - Include / exclude ONEWORLD / SKYTEAM / STAR_ALLIANCE
- `min_layover` / `max_layover` - Layover duration bounds in minutes
- `currency` / `language` / `country` - Google `curr=` / `hl=` / `gl=` URL params
- `sort_by` - CHEAPEST, DURATION, DEPARTURE_TIME, ARRIVAL_TIME

### `search_dates`
Find cheapest travel dates within a range.

**Key Parameters:**
- `origin` / `destination` - Airport IATA codes
- `start_date` / `end_date` - Date range in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `trip_duration` - Number of days for round trips
- `is_round_trip` - Boolean for round-trip search
- `cabin_class`, `max_stops`, `departure_window`, `airlines` - Same as above
- `exclude_airlines`, `alliance`, `exclude_alliance`, `min_layover`, `max_layover` - Same as `search_flights`
- `currency`, `language`, `country` - Same locale knobs as `search_flights`
- `sort_by_price` - Boolean to sort by price

### Note on emissions
Both tools accept the `emissions` filter (forwarded to Google's
"less emissions" toggle as `LESS`), but raw CO₂ figures are intentionally
**not** returned in CLI output or MCP tool responses. The filter operates
server-side; the data is not displayed in the current release.

## Releasing

The Python (`flights` on PyPI) and JavaScript (`fli-js` on npm) packages
are versioned and released **independently**, but with the same shape:
manual `workflow_dispatch` → bump → tag → GitHub Release → publish.

**PyPI** is cut via `.github/workflows/release.yml`
(Actions → Release → Run workflow on `main`). Choose
`bump=patch|minor|major|explicit`; the workflow bumps `pyproject.toml`,
refreshes `uv.lock`, commits + tags `vX.Y.Z` + creates a GitHub Release,
then calls `publish.yml` to upload to PyPI via Trusted Publishing.

**npm** is cut via `.github/workflows/release-npm.yml`
(Actions → Release npm → Run workflow on `main`). Same bump options;
the workflow bumps `fli-js/package.json`, refreshes `fli-js/bun.lock`,
commits + tags `fli-js-vX.Y.Z` + creates a GitHub Release, then calls
`publish-npm.yml` to build (`tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`) and upload to
npm with `--provenance` (uses the `NPM_TOKEN` secret).

Always run with `dry_run=true` first to preview the version and release
notes. The version-bump logic lives in `scripts/bump_version.py` (covered
by `tests/scripts/test_bump_version.py`); the same script handles both
`pyproject.toml` (via `--pyproject`) and `package.json` (via
`--package-json`), and the tag prefix is controlled by `--tag-prefix`.
Full process: `docs/guides/release.md` (PyPI), `docs/guides/release-npm.md` (npm).

## Code Style and Standards

- **Linting**: Uses Ruff with pycodestyle, pyflakes, isort, flake8-bugbear, and pydocstyle
- **Formatting**: Ruff formatter with 100 character line length, 4-space indentation
- **Type Hints**: Python 3.10+ with full type annotations
- **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings (configured in mkdocs.yml)
- **Testing**: pytest with asyncio support and parallel execution capabilities

## Important Implementation Notes

- Google Flights API integration requires careful rate limiting (handled automatically)
- Airport and airline codes use official IATA standards
- Flight search supports complex filters: time ranges, cabin classes, stop preferences, sorting
- Date search finds cheapest flights within flexible date ranges
- MCP server uses industry-standard naming: `origin`/`destination`, `cabin_class`, `max_stops`
- Core utilities ensure consistent parsing between CLI and MCP interfaces
